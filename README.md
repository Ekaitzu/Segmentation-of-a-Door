## Segmentation-of-a-Door
The task is about recognition of the position of the door in the image and the corner points of the door.
The problem is divided in five subtasks:
 - Image preprocessing: improve contrast in the image and suppress noise.
 - Feature extraction: generate features for door gap detection.
 - Image segmentation: segment pixels belonging to the door gap.
 - 2D image measurement: determine location of linear sections of door gap.
 - Classification: classify door gap sections and measure and classify 2D corner points.
